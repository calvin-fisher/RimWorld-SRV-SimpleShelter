Simple shelter door and walls for temporary survival structures.

Taken from CuproPanda's Survivalist's Additions, re-balanced, and packaged as a stand-alone mod.

The shelter structures now have a beauty penalty as a tradeoff for being quick and easy to construct. They are also slightly flimsier than before.

Backwards-compatibile with games saved with the full mod. If you only used the shelter wall and door, just uninstall Survivalist's Additions, install this mod, and you no longer have a dependency on all the other pieces.
